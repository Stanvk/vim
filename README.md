## Stanvk's work environment ##

This readme guides you to the process of setting up my workspace.
I've made two guides: one for MacOS and one for GNU/Linux (Ubuntu in my case). If you make use of Windows I highly recommend to install Ubuntu (or any other Linux distro for that matter).

### MacOS ###
On a fresh MacOs install, one of the first things I do is install [homebrew]('https://brew.sh'), a well-known package manager of MacOs.
After installing Homebrew, or Brew, let's get rid of Terminal.app and install iTerm2.
```bash
brew install iterm2
```

Let's now change bash in favour of Z-shell. Firstly 
```bash

```
